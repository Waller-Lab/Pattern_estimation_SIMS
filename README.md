# Pattern_estimation_SIMS


This is a MATLAB implementation of pattern estimation structured illumination microscopy with a statistical prior. It reconstructs fluorescent super-resolution image from structured illuminated images with unknown random patterns. For detail explanation, please see our paper [1].
