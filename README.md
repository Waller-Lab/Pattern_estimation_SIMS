# Pattern_estimation_SIMS


This is a MATLAB implementation of pattern estimation structured illumination microscopy with a statistical prior. It reconstructs fluorescent super-resolution image from structured illuminated images with unknown random patterns. For detail explanation, please see our paper [1]. To use this code, please also cite [1]. You can download the data used in the paper with the link in [2]. <br/>
